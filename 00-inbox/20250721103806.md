# Morphism
A morphism goes from one object to another.
Also called arrows.
Morphisms are composable, if there exists morphisms $f: A \rightarrow B$ and $g: B \rightarrow C$, then there exists the composition $g \circ f: A \rightarrow C$ (Pronounced "g after f").

## Real world concrete
Morphisms can represent different things, irrelevant in the view of the category(that's the point). A common way to view morphisms is as representing functions. For example, functions between sets(types) can be modelled as morphisms between objects.
